## ENEMY_DIFFICULTY

Many enemies' health is based on the `ENEMY_DIFFICULTY` variable, which is
either 0, 1, or 2.  This value is determined by the number of players who have
the S weapon.

!(TODO) There is some code that sets this to 4, but I don't know when it executes.

## Shared Enemy Attributes

Many enemies have their bit 2 set when alive, and clear when destroyed (see
`strip_alive_attr_remove_enemy`).  Many enemies have their bit 1 set when
destroyed (see `enemy_explosion_routine_00`/`bg_enemy_explosion_routine_00`)

### 00 - Weapon Item

Gives the player various power-ups/weapons upgrades.  It is a letter
representing the weapon type surrounded by wings.

### 02 - Bullet

Used for both regular red bullets and silver metal bullets.  First a muzzle
flash is shown, and then the actual bullet sprite is used.  Much of this logic
is shared between regular enemy bullets,
[Overhead Level Bullet](#0e---overhead-level-bullet), and the
[Overhead Tank Soldier Bullet](#30---overhead-tank-soldier-bullet) fired by the
[Overhead Tank Soldier](#20---overhead-tank-soldier)
